Semester Projects ( sketch or proposal + project )
1. A ‘performing program’, i.e. it has a discernible behavior, resulting in some kind of generating
graphics, drawing patterns or repeating vector animation. Thus it attracts attention and hopefully has
some kind of personality.
2. A ‘responsive object’ that reacts with changeable behaviors in response either to actions/changes
in its immediate environment, or in response to data or events somewhere else. This tends to convey
the impression that it is a type of living thing, as we are familiar with many animals that respond
differently depending on what’s going on around them, how they are treated, etc.
